// This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
// You can add your own extra polyfills to this file.

// Used for reflect-metadata in JIT. If using AOT (and only Angular decorators), you probably don't need it.
// import 'core-js/es/reflect'; // Example, often not needed with modern Angular CLI if using AOT

// Zone.js is required by Angular itself.
import 'zone.js';  // Included with Angular CLI.
